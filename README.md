# Image Statistical Analyzer

This project is a simple Python GUI application that allows users to load a color image and analyze it by calculating various statistical measures. The measures include Average, Variance, Normalized Variance, Nth Moments, Uniformity, and Entropy for each RGB color channel.

## Features

- **Browse and Load Images**: Easily select images from your computer.
- **Visualize Image**: Display the selected image within the GUI.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Average (R, G, B)
  - Variance (R, G, B)
  - Normalized Variance (R, G, B)
  - 3rd Moments (R, G, B)
  - Uniformity (R, G, B)
  - Entropy (R, G, B)
